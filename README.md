# creditCardFraudDetection
This is the source code in Python for the Credit Card Fraud Detection Project in Machine Learning. It is a classification problem under Supervised learning. Training examples consist of 284,807 observations (provided by Kaggle). Two algorithms were implemented:
1. A local out wire factor to calculate anomaly scores.
2. Isolation forced algorithm.
Exploratory analysis of the dataset was done along with the formation of the correlation matrix to see if there is a strong correlation between different variables in the dataset.
Finally, Fraud cases were identified with an accuracy of 0.9973 using Isolation Forest whereas accuracy was found to be 0.9965 when Local Outlier Factor was used.
